                                    <p class="">The Mary, Mother of God SCC is a close-knit community of individuals who
                                        gather together to honor and emulate the virtues of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
                                        Just as Mary said "yes" to
                                        God's plan with unwavering faith and humility, our
                                        SCC seeks to deepen our relationship with God and follow in her footsteps. In
                                        our SCC, we find inspiration
                                        in Mary's devotion to her Son, Jesus, and her role as the Mother of God. We
                                        strive to cultivate a deep love for Jesus and a heartfelt devotion to Mary,
                                        recognizing

                                    </p>

                                    <p>

                                        Through regular meetings, prayer gatherings, and Marian devotions, we come
                                        together to express our love for Mary and seek her guidance and intercession in
                                        our lives. We delve into the mysteries of the Rosary, meditating on the life of
                                        Jesus through Mary's eyes and finding solace in her motherly care and
                                        protection.

                                        Our SCC also emphasizes the importance of nurturing our relationships as a
                                        spiritual family. We support one another in our personal journeys of faith,
                                        offering a listening ear, words of encouragement, and a helping hand when
                                        needed. Together, we strive to grow in holiness, just as Mary did, by fostering
                                        virtues such as humility, compassion, and surrender to God's will.

                                        As members of the Mary, Mother of God SCC, we are not only devoted to our
                                        blessed Mother, but we also extend her love and compassion to others. We
                                        actively engage in acts of charity, reaching out to those in need and sharing
                                        the message of God's love and mercy with our community. We strive to emulate
                                        Mary's selfless love, seeking opportunities to serve and uplift those around us.

                                        Joining the Mary, Mother of God SCC is an invitation to deepen your relationship
                                        with Jesus and to embrace the tender love and guidance of the Blessed Virgin
                                        Mary. Together, let us grow in holiness, drawing strength from Mary's example,
                                        and allowing her to lead us closer to her Son, our Lord and Savior.

                                        us with seemingly insurmountable obstacles, and it is during these moments that
                                        the intercession of St. Jude can bring solace and strength.

                                        In our SCC, we come together to share our stories, offer support, and pray for
                                        one another. We create a safe and non-judgmental space where individuals can
                                        openly express their struggles, knowing that they will be met with empathy and
                                        understanding. Through prayer meetings, group discussions, and spiritual
                                        reflections, we seek to deepen our trust in God's providence and the
                                        intercession of St. Jude.

                                        Just as St. Jude tirelessly advocated for those in desperate situations, our SCC
                                        extends its outreach to those in need within our community. We actively engage
                                        in acts of charity and service, extending a helping hand to the marginalized,
                                        the vulnerable, and the forgotten. By emulating St. Jude's selflessness, we
                                        strive to be a source of hope and support to those who may feel lost or
                                        abandoned.

                                        Within the St. Jude SCC, we believe that no challenge is too great when
                                        approached with faith, community, and the intercession of our patron saint. We
                                        draw strength from St. Jude's unwavering belief in the power of God's love and
                                        mercy, as we navigate through life's trials together.

                                        If you are facing desperate circumstances or simply seek a community that
                                        understands and supports you, we invite you to join us at the St. Jude SCC.
                                        Together, let us lean on the intercession of St. Jude and discover the hope and
                                        resilience that faith can bring, even in the midst of our darkest moments.</p>

                                        the patron saint of social justice and charitable works. Inspired by the life
                                        and teachings of St. Martin of Tours, we
                                        come together to actively live
                                        out our faith by serving those in need and fostering a spirit of generosity and
                                        inclusivity. In our SCC, we strive to emulate St. Martin's spirit of
                                        selflessness and his
                                        deep commitment to helping others. We believe that our faith should be reflected
                                        in our actions and that true

                                        deep commitment to helping others. We believe that our faith should be reflected
                                        in our actions and that true discipleship involves reaching out to those who are
                                        marginalized, oppressed, or suffering.

                                        Through regular gatherings, discussions, and service projects, we deepen our
                                        understanding of social justice issues and explore practical ways to make a
                                        positive impact in our community. We collaborate with local organizations,
                                        participate in outreach programs, and organize initiatives to address issues
                                        such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.

                                        The St. Martin SCC also serves as a place of refuge and support for individuals
                                        who are seeking solace, healing, or guidance. We foster an atmosphere of
                                        acceptance and empathy, where everyone is welcomed, valued, and embraced. Our
                                        SCC members offer listening ears, compassionate hearts, and a network of support
                                        to those facing personal challenges, providing a sense of belonging and
                                        encouragement along their spiritual journey.

                                        As a community dedicated to St. Martin's legacy, we recognize the importance of
                                        personal and spiritual growth. We engage in regular prayer, reflection, and
                                        Bible study to deepen our relationship with God and to gain wisdom from His
                                        word. We encourage one another to cultivate virtues such as humility,
                                        compassion, and integrity, following in the footsteps of our patron saint.

                                        The St. Martin SCC invites individuals who are passionate about social justice,
                                        charitable works, and building a more inclusive society to join us. Together,
                                        let us live out our faith in tangible ways, inspiring others through acts of
                                        service and fostering a community where love, justice, and compassion are at the
                                        core of all we do.

                                        martyr and deacon, known for his unwavering faith,courage, and dedication to
                                        serving others. Inspired by St. Stephen's example, we gather
                                        together to deepen our faith, grow in holiness, and actively engage in acts of
                                        service and evangelization.

                                        In our SCC, we seek to embody the spirit of St. Stephen by fostering a strong
                                        sense of community and unity. We come together to worship, pray, and support one
                                        another in our spiritual journeys. Through regular meetings, fellowship
                                        gatherings, and faith-sharing sessions, we create an environment where
                                        individuals can deepen their understanding of the Gospel and develop a personal
                                        relationship with Jesus Christ.

                                        Following St. Stephen's example of service, we actively engage in outreach
                                        activities to extend God's love and compassion to those in need. Whether it's
                                        through charitable works, volunteering at local organizations, or providing
                                        assistance to marginalized communities, our SCC strives to be a visible sign of
                                        Christ's presence in the world.

                                        St. Stephen also serves as an inspiration for us to boldly proclaim and defend
                                        our faith. We encourage members to actively participate in evangelization
                                        efforts, sharing the good news of Jesus Christ with others through both words
                                        and actions. We seek to equip one another with the knowledge and confidence to
                                        articulate and defend our beliefs, promoting dialogue and understanding in our
                                        communities.

                                        As a community named after St. Stephen, we also embrace the values of
                                        forgiveness, humility, and reconciliation. We recognize the importance of
                                        seeking healing and unity, both within our SCC and in the wider world. We
                                        encourage open dialogue, mutual respect, and a spirit of forgiveness, as we
                                        strive to build bridges and mend broken relationships.

                                        Joining the St. Stephen SCC means becoming part of a community that is committed
                                        to growing in faith, serving others, and fearlessly proclaiming the Gospel.
                                        Together, let us draw inspiration from St. Stephen's life and martyrdom,
                                        embracing his virtues of faith, service, and courage, as we strive to make a

                                        Inspired by the life and teachings of St. Therese of Lisieux, we come together

                                        of love and kindness have the power to transform the world. Through regular
                                        meetings, prayer gatherings, and reflections on St. Therese's writings, we
                                        strive to deepen our understanding of her spirituality and apply it to our daily
                                        lives.

                                        The St. Therese SCC provides a nurturing and supportive environment where
                                        individuals can share their spiritual journeys and encourage one another in
                                        their faith. We emphasize the importance of simplicity, humility, and trust in
                                        God's providence. Together, we learn to surrender our worries, doubts, and
                                        insecurities to God, relying on His mercy and love to guide us along the path of
                                        holiness.

                                        St. Therese's devotion to the mission of the Church also inspires us to be
                                        active participants in spreading the love of Christ. As a community, we engage
                                        in acts of service and evangelization, seeking to bring God's light and
                                        compassion to those around us. We support missionary endeavors, participate in
                                        outreach programs, and strive to be instruments of God's healing and
                                        reconciliation in the world.

                                        Within the St. Therese SCC, we also cultivate a spirit of prayer and
                                        contemplation. We encourage members to deepen their personal prayer lives,
                                        fostering an intimate connection with God. Through quiet reflection, meditation,
                                        and devotion, we seek to grow in our love for God and to listen attentively to
                                        His gentle whispers in our hearts.

                                        If you are seeking a community that embraces simplicity, love, and a childlike
                                        trust in God, we invite you to join us at the St. Therese SCC. Together, let us
                                        learn from St. Therese's example of joyful surrender to God's will, and through
                                        our little acts of love, may we become channels of God's grace and bringers of
                                        hope in our world.

                                    <p class="">Named after the patron saint of compassion and mercy, the St. Veronica
                                        SCC is a community that embraces the spirit of selflessness and empathy.
                                        Inspired by the story of St. Veronica's act of kindness towards Jesus on His way to Calvary, we come
                                        together to deepen our understanding of compassion and to extend that compassion
                                        to others.
                                    </p>

                                        In the St. Veronica SCC, we seek to embody the virtues of love, mercy, and
                                        solidarity. Just as St. Veronica showed compassion by wiping the face of Jesus,
                                        we strive to recognize the face of Christ in those we encounter in our daily
                                        lives. Through regular gatherings, prayer sessions, and reflections on St.
                                        Veronica's example, we aim to develop a greater sensitivity to the needs of
                                        others and to respond with acts of love and kindness.

                                        Our SCC fosters a welcoming and inclusive environment where individuals can
                                        share their joys, sorrows, and struggles. We provide a safe space for open
                                        dialogue, mutual support, and encouragement, recognizing that each person's
                                        journey is unique and valuable. Through our collective experiences and shared
                                        faith, we strive to uplift and accompany one another on the path of
                                        discipleship.

                                        As members of the St. Veronica SCC, we actively engage in works of mercy and
                                        charitable endeavors. We reach out to the marginalized, the lonely, and the
                                        suffering, offering practical assistance, a listening ear, and a compassionate
                                        heart. We collaborate with local organizations and actively participate in
                                        initiatives that promote justice, fairness, and dignity for all.

                                        Within our SCC, we also recognize the importance of personal growth and
                                        spiritual nourishment. We encourage individuals to deepen their relationship
                                        with God through prayer, Scripture study, and the sacraments. By drawing
                                        inspiration from St. Veronica's courage and selflessness, we strive to cultivate
                                        a greater capacity for love and compassion in our own lives.

                                        If you are seeking a community that embraces the values of compassion, mercy,
                                        and solidarity, we invite you to join us at the St. Veronica SCC. Together, let
                                        us follow in the footsteps of our patron saint, extending the love of Christ to
                                        all, and making a positive difference in the lives of those we encounter.</p>

                                        spreading the Gospel. Inspired by the life and teachings of St. Paul, we come together to
                                        deepen our faith, grow in knowledge and
                                        understanding of God's Word, and actively

                                        In our SCC, we seek to embody the spirit of St. Paul's missionary journey, as we
                                        strive to share the love and truth of Jesus Christ with others. Through regular
                                        meetings, prayer gatherings, and Bible study sessions, we explore the richness
                                        of Scripture and seek to apply its timeless teachings to our lives. We encourage
                                        open dialogue and thoughtful discussions, allowing for personal growth and a
                                        deeper connection to our faith.

                                        The St. Paul SCC places a strong emphasis on evangelization and discipleship. We
                                        recognize that each member is called to be a witness to the Gospel in their own
                                        unique way. Through intentional outreach efforts, mentorship programs, and
                                        supportive relationships, we aim to equip and empower one another to boldly
                                        proclaim our faith and make a positive impact in the world around us.

                                        Just as St. Paul's conversion experience transformed his life, we also recognize
                                        the power of personal transformation through encountering Christ. We encourage
                                        individuals to deepen their personal relationship with Jesus, nurturing a
                                        vibrant prayer life and seeking the guidance of the Holy Spirit. We embrace the
                                        diversity of spiritual gifts within our SCC, fostering an environment where
                                        everyone is encouraged to use their talents and abilities to serve God and
                                        others.

                                        As members of the St. Paul SCC, we are not only committed to personal growth and
                                        evangelization but also to building a strong sense of community. We support one
                                        another through times of joy and difficulty, offering encouragement,
                                        accountability, and friendship. We strive to foster an environment of mutual
                                        respect, acceptance, and genuine love, reflecting the unity and diversity of the
                                        Body of Christ.
